                            Click on "Scan Pack" and allow the application to use the camera. In a decently lit
                            environment, align
                            the
                            pack physically to the scanning area and wait for a green indicator and beep sound. Once the

                            scanned
                            successfully a code appears. Click on the "Product information" button to view the leaflet.

                            There are multiple reasons why the code on your pack could not be resolved. One of the
                            reasons being
                            that
                            the code is illegible or out of focus for the camera. Please try to scan the code in a well
                            lit place
                            and code
                            clearly visible on the screen. The other reason could be that the product is not a part of
                            the product
                            database of PharmaLedger yet. Please check with the manufacturer if their product is a part
