        <psk-accordion-item title="4. Why does my 2D code not give a result?">
            There are multiple reasons why the code on your pack could not be resolved. One of the reasons being that
            the code is illegible or out of focus for the camera. Please try to scan the code in a well lit place and code
            clearly visible on the screen. The other reason could be that the product is not a part of the product
            database of PharmaLedger yet. Please check with the manufacturer if their product is a part of the PharmaLedger yet.

        <psk-accordion-item title="5. What does the product status on my app indicate?">
            The product status indicator is used to verify if your pack is issued by the manufacturer. This doesn’t
            certify that the physical pack is authentic but is an assurance that it has been digitally verified and is available
            in the manufacturer's database.
